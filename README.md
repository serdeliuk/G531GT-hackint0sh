## Asus ROG STRIX G531GT Hackintosh -- Clover HOT-patches
### You can install all, Mojave, Catalina and/or BigSur with a single EFI and no reconfig.
#### You can disable/enable Nvidia video card easy than ever
##### This EFI is based on a pathed, by me, Clover 5139 that has OpenCore 0.6.4 that allow all OS-es to boot in SecureMode, including BigSur.<br>Please review the  config-oc.plist file
